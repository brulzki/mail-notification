This is a fork of Jean-Yves Lefort's excellent mail-notification. I am 
attempting to bring the code up to date with the latest GNOME releases, and to 
improve its build process.

The original README can be found in README.orig. The following dependencies 
apply to this forked version, in addition to those listed in README.orig:

    * gob 2.0.17 (for generating GObject .c and .h files)
